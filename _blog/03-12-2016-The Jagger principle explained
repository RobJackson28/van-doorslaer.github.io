I first read about the Jagger principle in a great book by Pat Shipman ( available from here). Basically, The Jagger principle states that "You can't always get what you want, but sometimes you find you get what you need." This is a pretty good analogy for the evolutionary process As a big Stones fan, I thought this was really cool. So when I needed a title for this blog, I decided to incorporate it. I just hope that Dr. Shipman does not mind!
